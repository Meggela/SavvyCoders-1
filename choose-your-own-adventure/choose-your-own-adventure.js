A bronze drinking vessel rests to the side of the spring, among moss & stones. Will you fill the vessel with water and drink?",

Gradually, you notice that your feet no longer have hard contact with the soil beneath them. Setting the vessel down on a stone, you take an experimental step and find that, by jumping, you can bounce high up in the air, seemingly defying gravity. Each time you land upon the ground, however, you see misty door-like portals through the trees that you couldnâ€™t see before drinking the water. Do you choose to keep bouncing or to investigate a portal?",
